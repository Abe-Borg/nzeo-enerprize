# Enerprize

## Description
Enerprize is an energy and carbon management platform that gamifies climate action planning for educational institutions. The goal of this tool is to engage stakeholders at all levels of a school organization in the climate action planning process, involving spending large amounts of public funds. Stakeholders include students, staff, district employees, administration, and the board of education, each interacting with the tool in different ways. It aims to educate about the impact of everyday amenities on greenhouse gas emissions and provide monitoring and decision-making capabilities for various organizational roles. District employees - specifically operations staff like food services, maintenance, facilities, and IT - would have monitoring capability to view and better manage their departmental energy and carbon intensity. Finally, the board of education would have site level data that aggregates the performance of each school site to guide decisions on where energy projects are most needed to provide equitable, high impact decarbonization solutions. This platform would involve the following steps to implement: 1) Benchmarking 2) Scoping 3) Execution 4) Verification.

## Main Features

### Step 1 - Benchmarking
- Establish a framework for a district's energy and carbon sources.
- Organize contestants by school site, organizational unit, or building number using campus maps and construction documents.
- Simplify the view of energy and carbon emissions for building operators.
- Ensure compatibility with available information for measurable and verifiable improvements.

### Step 2 - Scoping
- Engage the executive cabinet based on baseline evaluations to determine the scope of energy projects.
- Incorporate the scope of work into climate education and the Climate Action Plan, approved by the board of education.

### Step 3 - Execution
- Formalize the performance period start date in the Climate Action Plan.
- Award points in the Enerprize competition, with fair weighting for districts of all sizes.

### Feature 4 - Data Visualization
Overview: Enerprize platform will have simple graphs that compare monthly values of kWh and
CO2e intensity per student and per square foot. The dashboards shall also have the
capability to aggregate the information of all sites or manually filter out a single site.
Some of these features will be available for internal NZEO use – due to their technical
complexity (heat maps, 3D surface plots). Each of the sites shall have the following
capability:

- Dashboards showing baseline period (electric only (kWh and $), gas only (kBTU
and $), combined (kBTU and $)
- Dashboards showing intervention period (electric only (kWh and $), gas only
(kBTU and $), combined (kBTU and $)
- Dashboard showing performance period (electric only (kWh and $), gas only
(kBTU and $), combined (kBTU and $)
- Ability to zoom into daily profile (where 15m or hourly data available)
- Visual aid of energy and carbon intensity per student
- Bar Charts: for comparing energy usage and cost data across different periods
(baseline, intervention, performance). Use separate bar charts for electric (kWh
and $), gas (kBTU and $), and combined energy usage and costs. This makes it
easier to compare data across different energy sources and time periods.
- Line Graphs: Effective for showing trends over time, particularly useful for daily
profiles where 15-minute or hourly data is available.
- Pie Charts: Useful for showing the proportion of energy use or carbon emissions
from different sources.
- Heat Maps: Good for representing data density and variations over a time period
or across different areas.
- 3D Surface Plots: Combined variables of temperature, occupancy,
