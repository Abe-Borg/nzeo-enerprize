Proposed SQL Database Schema
1. User Table
    Table Name: User
    Description: Stores information about each user.
    Columns:
    UserID (Primary Key)
    Other user-related columns as per your existing schema (like name, email, etc.)

2. UsagePoint Table
    Table Name: UsagePoint
    Description: Represents a physical location or device where energy usage is measured.
    Columns:
    UsagePointID (Primary Key)
    UserID (Foreign Key, references User)
    ServiceCategoryKind (Integer)
    Other relevant details if available
3. MeterReading Table
    Table Name: MeterReading
    Description: Stores information about each meter reading.
    Columns:
    MeterReadingID (Primary Key)
    UsagePointID (Foreign Key, references UsagePoint)
    Published (DateTime)
    Updated (DateTime)

4. ReadingType Table
    Table Name: ReadingType
    Description: Contains information on how to interpret the readings.
    Columns:
    ReadingTypeID (Primary Key)
    PowerOfTenMultiplier (Integer)
    UOM (Unit of Measure, Integer)
    FlowDirection (Integer)

5. IntervalReading Table
    Table Name: IntervalReading
    Description: Detailed interval data associated with a meter reading.
    Columns:
    IntervalReadingID (Primary Key)
    MeterReadingID (Foreign Key, references MeterReading)
    Start (DateTime, converted from Unix timestamp)
    Duration (Integer, in seconds)
    Value (Decimal/Float)
    Timezone (String)
    Data Processing and Storage Workflow
    Parsing XML File:

Extract data from each section of the XML.
Convert Unix timestamps to DateTime.
Apply any necessary conversions or calculations (like using PowerOfTenMultiplier).
Storing Data:

For each User, UsagePoint, MeterReading, ReadingType, and IntervalReading, insert the extracted data into the respective tables.
Ensure foreign keys are correctly assigned to maintain relationships (e.g., MeterReading should reference the correct UsagePointID).
Handling New and Existing Data:

Implement logic to check if a record already exists (to avoid duplicates) and to update existing records if necessary.
User Uploads:

When a user uploads an XML file, parse the file, extract the data, and store it in the database with reference to the user's ID.
Data Integrity and Validation:

Ensure data integrity by validating XML structure and contents before processing.
Implement error handling for any inconsistencies or issues during parsing.
