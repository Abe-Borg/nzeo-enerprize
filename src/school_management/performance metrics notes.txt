lbs_natural_gas_from_therms, input is gas energy use in therms (this is shown on gas utility bills), this value is then converted to kBTUs (multiply by 99.976) and then the kBTUs value is converted to lbs Natural GAs (CH4) (multiply by 0.042) 

scope1_lbs_co2e_from_lbs_natural_gas, input is lbs_natural_gas_from_therms, then this value is converted to lbs CO2e (multiply by 25)
scope2_lbs_co2e_from_kwh_elec_camx_grid, first convert kwh to mwh (divid by 1000), then convert mwh to lbs co2e (multiply by 531.7)
